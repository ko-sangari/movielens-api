## â­• The project's purpose
The purpose of this project is to leverage the [Movielens 20M Dataset](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-20m-README.html) from [Movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) as its primary data source. It aims to provide a range of APIs for efficient data access and manipulation.

## â­• Before you begin
Before you begin, please follow these steps:

1. Create a folder named `datasets` in the `root` directory.
2. Download and extarct the [ml-20m](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m.zip) dataset in the `datasets` directory.

It should look like this:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ datasets
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ml-20m
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ links.csv
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ movies.csv
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ tags.csv
```

## â­• How to Run the Project
Navigate to the root of the project. <br>
To build the image from the Dockerfile, run:
```commandline
docker compose up --build -d
```

<br>Or, there's a `Makefile` for your convenience, so just run: (Check other commands too!)
```commandline
make run
```

<br>Now, you can check the **Swagger** URL for API documentation.
```commandline
http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/
```

<br>ðŸŒŸ Now, you need to load the `ml-20m` dataset in to the database.
```commandline
make load_data
```

<br>Or, If you want to run the project locally, you need to have `poetry` installed first.
```commandline
pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry run python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
poetry run python manage.py load_datasets
```

## â­• How to run tests
Run _pytest_ command to run the tests separately.<br>
```commandline
make tests
```

<br>And, what about Test Coverage?
```commandline
make coverage

# Backend Directory               Stmts   Miss  Cover
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Test Coverage TOTAL              255     30    88%
```

<br>ðŸŒŸ This project has been thoroughly checked with `mypy` for type consistency, and it currently passes all mypy checks without any issues.
```commandline
make mypy
```

## â­• Final step
```commandline
make coffee
```
